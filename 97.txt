(97:1) We have sent it down in the Night of Decree.

(97:2) And do you know what is the Night of Decree?

(97:3) The Night of Decree is better than one thousand months.

(97:4) The angels and the Spirit come down in it with the permission
of their Lord to carry out every matter.

(97:5) It is peaceful until the coming of dawn.
