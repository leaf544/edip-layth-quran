(90:1) I do swear by this land.

(90:2) And you are a dweller in this land.

(90:3) And a father and what he begets.

(90:4) We have created man in struggle.

(90:5) Does he think that no one is able to best him?

(90:6) He says: "I spent so much money!"

(90:7) Does he think that no one saw him?

(90:8) Did We not make for him two eyes?

(90:9) And a tongue and two lips?

(90:10) And We guided him to both paths?

(90:11) He should choose the better path.

(90:12) Do you know which is the better path?

(90:13) The freeing of slaves.

(90:14) Or the feeding on a day of great hardship.

(90:15) An orphan of relation.

(90:16) Or a poor person in need.

(90:17) Then he has become one of those who have believed, and exhort
one another to patience, and exhort one another to kindness.

(90:18) Those are the people of the right.

(90:19) As for those who rejected Our revelations, they are the people
of misery.

(90:20) Upon them is a Fire closed over.
