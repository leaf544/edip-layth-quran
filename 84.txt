(84:1) When the heaven is torn.

(84:2) And it admits its Lord, and is ready.

(84:3) And when the land is stretched.

(84:4) And it spits out what is in it and becomes empty.

(84:5) And it permits its Lord, and is ready.

(84:6) O man, you will be moving towards your Lord and meeting Him.

(84:7) Sowhoever is given his record in his right.

(84:8) Hewill then receive an easy reckoning.

(84:9) And he will return to his family in joy!

(84:10) Andas for he who is given his record behind his back.

(84:11) He will invoke his destruction.

(84:12) Andhe will enter a blazing Fire.

(84:13) He used to be joyful among his people!

(84:14) He thought he would not be returned.

(84:15) No,He is ever seeing of him.

(84:16) SoI do swear by the redness of dusk.

(84:17) Andthe night and what it is driven on.

(84:18) Andthe moon when it is full.

(84:19) Youwill ride a platform upon a platform.

(84:20) So what is the matter with them that they do not believe?

(84:21) Andwhen the Qur'an is read over them, they do not prostrate.

(84:22) No,those who have rejected are in denial.

(84:23) AndGod is more aware of what they gather.

(84:24) So inform them of a painful retribution.

(84:25) Except for those who believe and do good works, they will have
a reward that will not end.
