(100:1) By the fast gallopers.

(100:2) Striking sparks.

(100:3) Charging in the morning.

(100:4) Forming clouds of dust.

(100:5) Penetrating to the midst together.

(100:6) Surely, man is unappreciative to his Lord.

(100:7) He will indeed bear witness to this.

(100:8) He loves wealth tenaciously.

(100:9) Does he not realize that when what are in the graves are
scattered.

(100:10) And what is in the chests is gathered.

(100:11) That their Lord has been fully aware of them?
