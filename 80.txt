(80:1) He frowned and turned away.

(80:2) When the blind one came to him.

(80:3) And what makes you know, perhaps he is seeking to purify?

(80:4) Or to remember, so the remembrance will benefit him?

(80:5) As for the one who was rich.

(80:6) You were addressing yourself to him.

(80:7) And why does it concern you that he does not want to purify?

(80:8) And as for the one who came to you seeking.

(80:9) While he was concerned.

(80:10) You were too occupied for him.

(80:11) No, this is but a reminder.

(80:12) For whoever wills to remember.

(80:13) In scripts which are honorable.

(80:14) Raised and pure.

(80:15) By the hands of scribes.

(80:16) Honorable and righteous.

(80:17) Man is killed for his rejection.

(80:18) From what did He create him?

(80:19) From a seed He created him and molded him.

(80:20) Then the path He made easy for him.

(80:21) Then He made him die and buried him.

(80:22) Then if He wishes He resurrects him.

(80:23) Alas, when what has been ordained is complete.

(80:24) Let man look to his provisions.

(80:25) We have poured the water abundantly.

(80:26) Then We breached the land with cracks.

(80:27) And We made grow in it seeds.

(80:28) And grapes and pasture.

(80:29) And olives and palm trees.

(80:30) And gardens in variety.

(80:31) And fruits and vegetables.

(80:32) An enjoyment for you and your livestock.

(80:33) So when the screaming shout comes.

(80:34) The Day when a person will run from his brother.

(80:35) And his mother and his father.

(80:36) And his mate and his children.

(80:37) For every person on that Day is a matter that concerns him.

(80:38) Faces on that Day which are openly displayed.

(80:39) Laughing and seeking good news.

(80:40) And faces on that Day with dust on them.

(80:41) Being burdened by remorse.

(80:42) Those are the rejecters, the wicked.
