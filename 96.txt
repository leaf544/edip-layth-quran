(96:1) Read in the name of your Lord who has created.

(96:2) He created man from an embryo.

(96:3) Read, and your Lord is the Generous One.

(96:4) The One who taught by the pen.

(96:5) He taught man what he did not know.

(96:6) Alas, man is bound to transgress.

(96:7) When he achieves, he no longer has need!

(96:8) To your Lord is the return.

(96:9) Have you seen the one who prohibits,

(96:10) A servant from making the contact?

(96:11) Have you seen if he was being guided,

(96:12) Or he ordered righteousness?

(96:13) Have you seen if he lied and turned away?

(96:14) Did he not know that God can see?

(96:15) Alas, if he does not cease, We will strike the forelock.

(96:16) A forelock which lies and errs.

(96:17) So let him call on his supporter.

(96:18) We will call on the guardians.

(96:19) So do not obey him, prostrate and come near.
