(68:1) N, the pen, and what they write.

(68:2) You are not, by the blessing of your Lord, crazy.

(68:3) And you will have a reward that will not end.

(68:4) And you are of a high moral character.

(68:5) So you will see, and they will see.

(68:6) Which of you are condemned.

(68:7) Your Lord is fully aware of those who strayed off His path, and
He is fully aware of those who are guided.

(68:8) So do not obey those who deny.

(68:9) They wish that you compromise, so they too can compromise.

(68:10) And do not obey every lowly swearer.

(68:11) A slanderer, a backbiter.

(68:12) Forbidder of charity, a transgressor, a sinner.

(68:13) Unappreciative, and greedy.

(68:14) Because he possessed money and sons.

(68:15) When Our revelations are recited to him, he says: "Fictional
tales of old!"

(68:16) We will mark him on the path.

(68:17) We have tested them like We tested those who owned the farm,
when they swore that they will harvest it in the morning.

(68:18) They were without doubt.

(68:19) So a passing sent from your Lord came to it while they all
were asleep.

(68:20) Thus, it became barren.

(68:21) They called on one another when they awoke.

(68:22) "Let us go this morning to harvest the crop."

(68:23) So they went, while conversing.

(68:24) That from today, none of them would ever be poor.

(68:25) And they went, ready to harvest.

(68:26) But when they saw it, they said: "We have gone astray!"

(68:27) "Now, we have nothing!"

(68:28) The best among them said: "If only you had glorified!"

(68:29) They said: "Glory be to our Lord. We have transgressed."

(68:30) Then they started to blame each other.

(68:31) They said: "Woe to us. We sinned."

(68:32) "Perhaps our Lord will grant us better than it. We repent to
our Lord."

(68:33) Such was the punishment. But the retribution of the Hereafter
is far worse, if only they knew.

(68:34) The righteous have deserved, at their Lord, gardens of bliss.

(68:35) Should We treat those who submitted the same as those who are
criminals?

(68:36) What is wrong with you, how do you judge?

(68:37) Or do you have a book which you study?

(68:38) In it, you can find what you wish?

(68:39) Or do you have an oath from Us, extending until the Day of
Resurrection, that you can judge as you please?

(68:40) Ask them: "Who of them will make such a claim?"

(68:41) Or do they have partners? Then let them bring their partners,
if they are truthful.

(68:42) The Day will come when they will be exposed, and they will be
required to prostrate, but they will be unable to.

(68:43) With their eyes subdued, humiliation will cover them. They
were invited to prostrate when they were whole and able.

(68:44) Therefore, let Me deal with those who reject this narrative;
We will entice them from where they do not perceive.

(68:45) And I will lead them on; for My planning is formidable.

(68:46) Or do you ask them for a wage, so they are burdened by the
fine?

(68:47) Or do they know the future? So they have it recorded?

(68:48) You shall be patient for the judgment of your Lord. And do not
be like the companion of the whale who called out while he was in
sorrow.

(68:49) Had it not been for the grace of his Lord, he would have
remained trapped, while he was to be blamed.

(68:50) But his Lord blessed him, and made him righteous.

(68:51) And those who have rejected almost attack you with their eyes
when they hear the Reminder, and they say: "He is crazy!"

(68:52) And it is but a reminder for the worlds.
