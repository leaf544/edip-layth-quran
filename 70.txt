(70:1) Someone asked about the inevitable retribution.

(70:2) For the rejecters, there is nothing that will stop it.

(70:3) From God, Possessor of the ascending portals.

(70:4) The angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in a day which is
equivalent to fifty thousand years.

(70:5) So be patient with a good patience.

(70:6) They see it as far away.

(70:7) And We see it as near.

(70:8) On the Day the heaven is like molten copper.

(70:9) And the mountains are like wool.

(70:10) And no friend will ask about his friend.

(70:11) When they see it, the criminal will wish he can ransom his
children against the retribution.

(70:12) And his mate and his brother.

(70:13) And his relatives who sheltered him.

(70:14) And all who are on the earth, so that he can be saved!

(70:15) No, it is a torching flame.

(70:16) Eager to roast.

(70:17) It calls on those who turned away.

(70:18) And who hoarded and counted.

(70:19) Indeed, man was created anxious.

(70:20) When adversity touches him he is miserable.

(70:21) And when good touches him he is stingy.

(70:22) Except for those who make the contact prayer.

(70:23) Who always observe their contact prayer.

(70:24) And those who set aside part of their wealth.

(70:25) For the seeker and the denied.

(70:26) And those who believe in the Day of Recompense.

(70:27) And those who are fearful of the retribution of their Lord.

(70:28) The retribution of their Lord is not to be taken for granted.

(70:29) And those who keep covered their private parts.

(70:30) Except around their spouses or those maintained by their
oaths, there is no blame.

(70:31) Whoever seeks anything beyond this, they are the
transgressors.

(70:32) And those who look after what they have been entrusted to and
to their pledges.

(70:33) And those who uphold their testimonies.

(70:34) And those who maintain their contact prayer.

(70:35) They will be honored in gardens.

(70:36) So what is wrong with the rejecters staring at you?

(70:37) From the right and the left, in crowds?

(70:38) Does every one of them hope to enter a garden of bliss?

(70:39) No, We have created them from what they know.

(70:40) So I do swear by the Lord of the east and the west, that We
are able.

(70:41) To replace them with better people, We can never be defeated.

(70:42) So let them talk in vain and play, until they meet their Day
which they are promised.

(70:43) When they will come out of the graves in a rush, as if they
are racing towards a goal.

(70:44) Their eyes are cast down, with shame covering them. This is
the Day which they were promised.
