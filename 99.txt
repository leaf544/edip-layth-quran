(99:1) When the earth rumbles and shakes.

(99:2) And the earth brings out its mass.

(99:3) And man will say: "What is wrong with her?"

(99:4) On that Day it will inform its news.

(99:5) That your Lord had inspired her to do so.

(99:6) On that Day, the people will be brought out in throngs to be
shown their works.

(99:7) So whoever does the weight of an atom of good will see it.

(99:8) And whoever does the weight of an atom of evil will see it.
