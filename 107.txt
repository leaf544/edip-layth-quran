(107:1) Have you seen he who is denying in the system?

(107:2) It is the one who mistreats the orphan,

(107:3) And the one who does not encourage the feeding of the poor.

(107:4) So woe to those who make the contact prayer,

(107:5) Who are towards their contact prayer absent minded.

(107:6) They only want to be seen,

(107:7) And they withhold from any assistance.
