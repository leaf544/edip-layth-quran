(79:1) By those that take the person forcibly.

(79:2) And those that take the person gently.

(79:3) And those that swim along.

(79:4) And those that press forward in a race.

(79:5) So as to carry out a command.

(79:6) On the Day the ground shakes.

(79:7) It will be followed by the second blow.

(79:8) Hearts on that Day will be terrified.

(79:9) Their eyes cast down.

(79:10) They say: "Shall we be returned to live our lives."

(79:11) "Even after we were crumbled bones?"

(79:12) They said: "This is an impossible recurrence."

(79:13) But all it takes is one blow.

(79:14) Whereupon they will rise-up.

(79:15) Did the narrative of Moses come to you?

(79:16) His Lord called him at the holy valley of Tuwa.

(79:17) "Go to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed."

(79:18) Tell him: "Would you not be purified?"

(79:19) "And I will guide you to your Lord, that you may be
concerned."

(79:20) He then showed him the great sign.

(79:21) But he disbelieved and rebelled.

(79:22) Then he turned away in a hurry.

(79:23) So he gathered and proclaimed.

(79:24) He said: "I am your lord, the most high."

(79:25) So God seized him for punishment in the Hereafter, and for the
first life.

(79:26) In that is a lesson for those who are concerned.

(79:27) Are you a more powerful creation than the heaven which He
built?

(79:28) He raised its height, and perfected it.

(79:29) And He covered its night and brought out its morning.

(79:30) And the land after that He spread out.

(79:31) He brought forth from it its water and pasture.

(79:32) And the mountains He fixed firmly.

(79:33) All this to be a provision for you and your livestock.

(79:34) Then, when the great blow comes.

(79:35) The Day when man remembers all that he strove for.

(79:36) And Hell will be made apparent for all who can see.

(79:37) As for he who transgressed.

(79:38) And was preoccupied with the worldly life.

(79:39) Then Hell will be the abode.

(79:40) And as for he who feared the station of his Lord, and
prohibited the self from desire.

(79:41) The Paradise will be the abode.

(79:42) They ask you about the Hour: "When is its appointed time?"

(79:43) You have no knowledge of it.

(79:44) To your Lord is its term.

(79:45) You are simply to warn those who are concerned by it.

(79:46) For the Day they see it, it will be as if they had remained an
evening or half a day.
