(83:1) Woe to those who cheat.

(83:2) Those who when they are receiving any measure from the people,
they take it in full.

(83:3) And when they are the ones giving measure or weight, they give
less than due.

(83:4) Dothese not assume that they will be resurrected

(83:5) Toa great Day?

(83:6) The Day the people will stand before the Lord of the worlds.

(83:7) No, the record of the wicked is in 'Sijjeen.'

(83:8) And do you know what is 'Sijjeen?'

(83:9) A numbered record.

(83:10) Woeon that Day to the deniers.

(83:11) Those who denied the Day of Recompense.

(83:12) Andnone will deny it, except every transgressor, sinner.

(83:13) When Our revelations are recited to him, he says: "Fictional
tales of old!"

(83:14) No,a covering has been placed on their hearts for what they
have earned.

(83:15) No,they will be blocked from their Lord on that Day.

(83:16) Then they will be entered into Hell.

(83:17) Then it will be said: "This is what you used to deny!"

(83:18) No,the record of the pious is in 'Elliyeen.'

(83:19) Anddo you know what is 'Elliyeen?'

(83:20) A numbered record.

(83:21) To be witnessed by those brought near.

(83:22) Thepious are in the Paradise.

(83:23) Upon raised couches, they are looking.

(83:24) Youwill recognize in their faces the look of bliss.

(83:25) They are given to drink from a pure sealed vial.

(83:26) Itsseal will be of musk, so in that let those who are in
competition compete.

(83:27) Andits taste will be special.

(83:28) A spring from which those who are brought near will drink.

(83:29) Those who were criminals used to laugh at those who had
believed.

(83:30) Andwhen they passed by them they used to wink to each other.

(83:31) Andwhen they returned to their people, they would return
jesting.

(83:32) Andif they see them they say: "These are indeed misguided!"

(83:33) Butthey were not sent over them as caretakers.

(83:34) Andtoday, those who had believed are laughing at the
rejecters!

(83:35) Upon raised couches, they are looking.

(83:36) Have the rejecters been rewarded for what they used to do?
