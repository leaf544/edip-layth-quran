(69:1) The reality.

(69:2) What is the reality?

(69:3) Absolutely, do you know what is the reality?

(69:4) Thamud and 'Aad disbelieved in the Shocker.

(69:5) As for Thamud, they were annihilated by the devastation.

(69:6) And as for 'Aad, they were annihilated by a furious violent
wind.

(69:7) He unleashed it upon them for seven nights and eight days, in
succession. You could see the people destroyed in it, as if they are
decayed palm trunks.

(69:8) Do you see any legacy for them?

(69:9) And Pharaoh, and those before him, and the sinners, came with
wrongdoing.

(69:10) They disobeyed the messenger of their Lord. So He took them
with a devastating requital.

(69:11) And when the water flooded, We carried you on the vessel.

(69:12) That We would make it as a reminder for you, and so that any
listening ear may understand.

(69:13) And when the horn is blown once.

(69:14) And the earth and the mountains will be removed from their
place and crushed with a single crush.

(69:15) On that Day the unavoidable event will come to pass.

(69:16) And the sky will be torn, and on that Day it will be flimsy.

(69:17) And the angels will be on its borders; and the Throne of your
Lord will be carried, above them on that Day, by eight.

(69:18) On that Day, you will be exposed, nothing from you can be
hidden.

(69:19) As for the one who is given his record in his right, he will
say: "Here, come and read my record!"

(69:20) "I knew that I was going to be held accountable."

(69:21) So he shall be in a life, well-pleasing.

(69:22) In a lofty Paradise.

(69:23) Its fruits are within reach.

(69:24) "Eat and drink merrily in return for your works in days past."

(69:25) As for him who is given his record in his left, he will say:
"Oh, I wish I never received my record,"

(69:26) "And that I never knew my account,"

(69:27) "I wish the end had been final,"

(69:28) "My money cannot help me,"

(69:29) "All my power is gone."

(69:30) Take him and shackle him.

(69:31) Then to Hell cast him.

(69:32) Then, in a chain that is the length of seventy arms, tie him
up.

(69:33) For he did not believe in God, the Great.

(69:34) Nor did he advocate the feeding of the poor.

(69:35) Consequently, he has no friend here today.

(69:36) Nor any food, except from pollutants.

(69:37) Food for the wrongdoers.

(69:38) So I do swear by what you see.

(69:39) And what you do not see.

(69:40) This is the utterance of an honorable messenger.

(69:41) It is not the utterance of a poet; rarely do you believe.

(69:42) Nor the utterance of a soothsayer; rarely do you take heed.

(69:43) A revelation from the Lord of the worlds.

(69:44) And had he attributed anything falsely to Us.

(69:45) We would have seized him by the right.

(69:46) Then, We would have severed his life-line.

(69:47) None of you would be able to prevent it.

(69:48) And this is a reminder for the righteous.

(69:49) And We know that some of you are deniers.

(69:50) And that it is a distress for the rejecters.

(69:51) And it is the absolute truth.

(69:52) Therefore, you shall glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.
