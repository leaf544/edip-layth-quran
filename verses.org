(41:49) Man does not tire in praying for good things. But if adversity
touches him, he is disheartened, desperate!

(41:50) And when We let him taste a mercy from Us after hardship had
touched him, he will say: "This was by my actions, and I do not think
that the Hour will come to pass. And even if I am returned to my Lord,
I will find at Him good things for me." Surely, We will inform the
rejecters of all they had done, and We will let them taste the severe
retribution.

(41:51) And when We bless man, he withdraws and turns away, and when
he suffers any adversity, then he implores at length!
