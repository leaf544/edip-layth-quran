(93:1) By the late morning.

(93:2) And the night when it falls.

(93:3) Your Lord has not left you, nor did He forget you.

(93:4) And the Hereafter is better for you than the first.

(93:5) And your Lord will give you and you will be pleased.

(93:6) Did he not find you an orphan and He sheltered you?

(93:7) And He found you lost, and He guided you?

(93:8) And He found you in need, so He gave you riches?

(93:9) As for the orphan, you shall not make him sad.

(93:10) And as for the beggar, you shall not reprimand.

(93:11) And you shall proclaim the blessings from your Lord.
