(56:1) When the inevitable comes to pass.

(56:2) Nothing can stop it from happening.

(56:3) It will bring low, and raise up.

(56:4) When the earth will be shaken a terrible shake.

(56:5) And the mountains will be wiped out.

(56:6) So that they become only scattered dust.

(56:7) And you will be in three groupings.

(56:8) So those on the right, who will be from those on the right?

(56:9) And those on the left, who will be from those on the left?

(56:10) And those foremost, who will be from those foremost?

(56:11) They will be the ones who are brought near.

(56:12) In gardens of bliss.

(56:13) Many from the first generations.

(56:14) And a few from the later generations.

(56:15) Upon luxurious beds.

(56:16) Reclining in them, facing each other.

(56:17) Moving among them will be immortal children.

(56:18) With cups, pitchers, and a cup of pure drink.

(56:19) They do not get a headache from it, nor do they get exhausted.

(56:20) And fruits of their choice.

(56:21) And meat of birds that they desire.

(56:22) And wonderful companions.

(56:23) Like pearls which are sheltered.

(56:24) A reward for their works.

(56:25) They will not hear in it any nonsense, nor blame.

(56:26) Only the utterances of: "Peace. Peace."

(56:27) And those on the right, who will be with those on the right?

(56:28) In lush orchards.

(56:29) And fruit-trees which are ripe.

(56:30) And extended shade.

(56:31) And flowing water.

(56:32) And many fruits.

(56:33) Neither ending; nor disallowed.

(56:34) And raised furnishings.

(56:35) We have developed them completely.

(56:36) And made them never previously touched.

(56:37) Perfect, mature in age.

(56:38) For those on the right side.

(56:39) Many from the early generations.

(56:40) And many from the later generations.

(56:41) And those on the left, who will be from those on the left?

(56:42) In fierce hot winds and boiling water.

(56:43) And a shade that is unpleasant.

(56:44) Neither cool, nor helpful.

(56:45) They used to be indulged in luxury before this.

(56:46) And they persisted in the great oathbreaking.

(56:47) And they used to say: "After we die and turn to dust and
bones, we will get resurrected?"

(56:48) "And also our fathers of old?"

(56:49) Say: "The people of old and the later generations,"

(56:50) "Will be summoned to a meeting on a predetermined Day."

(56:51) "Then you, O rejecting strayers,"

(56:52) "Will eat from the tree of Bitterness,"

(56:53) "Filling your bellies therefrom,"

(56:54) "Then drinking on top of it boiling water,"

(56:55) "So you will drink like diseased camels!"

(56:56) Such is their share on the Day of Recompense.

(56:57) We have created you, if you could only believe!

(56:58) Have you noted the semen that you produce?

(56:59) Did you create it, or were We the Ones who have created it?

(56:60) We have predetermined death for you. Nothing can stop Us,

(56:61) From transforming your forms, and establishing you in what you
do not know.

(56:62) You have come to know about the first creation. If only you
would remember.

(56:63) Have you noted the crops you reap?

(56:64) Did you grow them, or were We the Ones who grew them?

(56:65) If We wished, We can turn them into hay. Then you will be left
in wonderment:

(56:66) "We are lost."

(56:67) "No, we are deprived!"

(56:68) Have you noted the water you drink?

(56:69) Did you send it down from the clouds, or is it We who sent it
down?

(56:70) If We wished, We can make it salty. If only you would give
thanks.

(56:71) Have you noted the fire you kindle?

(56:72) Did you establish its tree, or was it We who established it?

(56:73) We rendered it a reminder, and a useful tool for the users.

(56:74) You shall glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.

(56:75) I do swear by the positions of the stars.

(56:76) This is an oath, if only you knew, that is great.

(56:77) It is an honorable Qur'an.

(56:78) In a protected Book.

(56:79) None can grasp it except those purified.

(56:80) A revelation from the Lord of the worlds.

(56:81) Are you disregarding this narrative?

(56:82) And you have your provisions, yet you are denying?

(56:83) So when the time comes and it reaches your throat.

(56:84) And at that moment you look around.

(56:85) We are closer to it than you are, but you do not see.

(56:86) So if you do not owe any account.

(56:87) Then return it, if you are truthful?

(56:88) So, if he is one of those who are made near.

(56:89) Then joy, and rose buds, and gardens of bliss.

(56:90) And if he is one of the people of the right.

(56:91) Then: "Peace" from the people of the right.

(56:92) But if he is one of the deniers, the strayers.

(56:93) Then an abode of boiling water.

(56:94) And a burning in Hell.

(56:95) This is the absolute truth.

(56:96) You shall glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.
