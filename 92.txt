(92:1) By the night when it covers.

(92:2) And by the day when it appears.

(92:3) And by what He has created, the male and female.

(92:4) Your works are various.

(92:5) As for he who gives and is righteous.

(92:6) And trusts in goodness.

(92:7) We will make for him the easy path.

(92:8) And as for he who is stingy and holds back.

(92:9) And denies goodness.

(92:10) We will make for him the difficult path.

(92:11) And his wealth will not avail him when he demises.

(92:12) It is upon Us to guide.

(92:13) And to Us is the end and the beginning.

(92:14) I have warned you of a Fire that blazes.

(92:15) None shall have it except the wicked.

(92:16) The one who denies and turns away.

(92:17) As for the righteous, he will be spared it.

(92:18) The one who gives his money to purify.

(92:19) Seeking nothing in return.

(92:20) Except the face of His Lord, the Most High.

(92:21) And he will be pleased.
