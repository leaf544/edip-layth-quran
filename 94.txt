(94:1) Did We not comfort your chest,

(94:2) And take from you your load,

(94:3) Which had put strain on your back?

(94:4) And We have raised your remembrance,

(94:5) So with hardship comes ease.

(94:6) With hardship comes ease.

(94:7) So when you are done, then stand.

(94:8) And to your Lord you shall seek.
