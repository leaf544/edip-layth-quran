(98:1) Those who rejected among the people of the Book and the
polytheists would not leave until a proof came to them.

(98:2) A messenger from God reciting purified scripts.

(98:3) In them are valuable books.

(98:4) And those who had previously received the Book did not divide
except after the proof came to them.

(98:5) And they were not commanded except to serve God and be loyal to
His system, monotheists, and hold the contact prayer and contribute
towards purification. Such is the valuable system.

(98:6) Those who rejected from the people of the Book and the
polytheists are in the fires of Hell abiding therein, those are the
worst of creation.

(98:7) As for those who believe and do good works, they are the best
of creation.

(98:8) Their reward with their Lord are gardens of delight with rivers
flowing beneath them, abiding therein eternally. God is satisfied with
them, and they are satisfied with Him. That is for whoever is
concerned towards His Lord.
