(95:1) By the fig and the olive.

(95:2) And the mount of ages.

(95:3) And this land of peace.

(95:4) We have created man in the best form.

(95:5) Then We returned him to the lowest of the low ones.

(95:6) Except those who have believed and done good works, they will
have a reward that will not end.

(95:7) So what would make you deny the system after that?

(95:8) Is God not the Wisest of the wise ones?
