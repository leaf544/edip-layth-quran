(82:1) When the heaven is cracked.

(82:2) And when the planets are scattered.

(82:3) And when the seas burst.

(82:4) And when the graves are laid open.

(82:5) Then the soul will know what it has brought forth and what it
has left behind.

(82:6) O man, what made you arrogant against your Lord, the Generous?

(82:7) The One who has created you, then evolved you, then made you
upright?

(82:8) Inany which picture He chooses, He places you.

(82:9) No, you are but deniers of the system.

(82:10) Andover you are those who watch.

(82:11) Honorable scribes.

(82:12) They know what you do.

(82:13) Thepious are in the Paradise.

(82:14) Andthe wicked are in Hell.

(82:15) They will enter it on the Day of Recompense.

(82:16) Andthey will not be absent from it.

(82:17) Anddo you know what is the Day of Recompense?

(82:18) Then again, do you know what is the Day of Recompense?

(82:19) TheDay when no soul possesses anything for any other soul, and
the decision on that Day is to God.
