(1:1) Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.

(1:2) The Almighty, the Merciful.

(1:3) Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.

(1:4) You alone we serve, and You alone we seek for help.

(1:5) Guide us to the straight path.

(1:6) The path of those You have blessed, not of those who have
incurred the wrath, nor the misguided.
