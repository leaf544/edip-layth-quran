(86:1) By the heaven and the herald.

(86:2) And do you know what the herald is?

(86:3) The piercing star.

(86:4) Every soul has a recorder over it.

(86:5) Solet man see from what he was created.

(86:6) Hewas created from a water that spurts forth.

(86:7) Itcomes out from between the spine and the testicles.

(86:8) For He is able to bring him back.

(86:9) The Day when all is revealed.

(86:10) Then he will not have any power or victor.

(86:11) Andthe sky which gives rain.

(86:12) Andthe land with cracks.

(86:13) This is the word that separates matters.

(86:14) Andit is not a thing for amusement.

(86:15) They are planning a plan.

(86:16) AndI am planning a plan.

(86:17) So respite the rejecters, respite them for a while.
