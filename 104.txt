(104:1) Woe to every backbiter, slanderer.

(104:2) Who gathered his wealth and counted it.

(104:3) He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal.

(104:4) Never! He will be thrown into the Destroyer.

(104:5) And do you know what is the Destroyer?

(104:6) The kindled Fire of God.

(104:7) Which reaches the inside of the hearts.

(104:8) It will confine them therein.

(104:9) In extended columns.
