(88:1) Has the narrative of that which will overwhelm come to you?

(88:2) Faces on that Day which will be shamed.

(88:3) Laboring and weary.

(88:4) They will enter a blazing Fire.

(88:5) And be given to drink from a boiling spring.

(88:6) They will have no food except from a thorny plant.

(88:7) Itdoes not nourish nor avail against hunger.

(88:8) And faces on that Day which are soft.

(88:9) For their pursuit they are content.

(88:10) In a high paradise.

(88:11) Youwill not hear in it any nonsense.

(88:12) In it is a running spring.

(88:13) In it are raised beds.

(88:14) Andcups that are set.

(88:15) Andcushions arranged in rows.

(88:16) Andrich carpets spread out.

(88:17) Will they not look at the camels, how were they created?

(88:18) Andto the sky, how was it raised?

(88:19) Andto the mountains, how were they set?

(88:20) And to the land, how was it flattened?

(88:21) So remind, for you are but a reminder.

(88:22) You have no power over them.

(88:23) Except for he who turns away and rejects.

(88:24) Then God will punish him with the great retribution.

(88:25) Indeed, to Us is their return.

(88:26) Then to Us is their judgment.
