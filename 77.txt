(77:1) By the winds which are sent.

(77:2) So the gusts then blow.

(77:3) And all that is scattered about.

(77:4) So the separators which divide.

(77:5) Then the remembrance that is found.

(77:6) An excuse or a warning.

(77:7) What you are being promised will come to pass.

(77:8) So when the stars are plunged.

(77:9) And when the heaven is opened.

(77:10) And when the mountains are destroyed.

(77:11) And when the messengers are gathered.

(77:12) For what day has it been delayed?

(77:13) For the Day of Separation.

(77:14) And do you know what is the Day of Separation?

(77:15) Woe on that Day to the disbelievers!

(77:16) Did We not destroy the ancient people?

(77:17) Then We made others to succeed them.

(77:18) It is such that We do to the criminals.

(77:19) Woe on that Day to the disbelievers!

(77:20) Did We not create you from a fragile water,

(77:21) Then We made it in a place of protection,

(77:22) Until a time that is predetermined?

(77:23) So We measured, and We are the best to measure.

(77:24) Woe on that Day to the disbelievers!

(77:25) Did We not make the earth an abode,

(77:26) Living and dead.

(77:27) And We made massive stabilizers in it, and We gave you to
drink fresh water?

(77:28) Woe on that Day to the disbelievers!

(77:29) Away with you towards what you have disbelieved.

(77:30) Away with you to a shadow with three columns.

(77:31) Neither does it shade, nor does it avail from the flames.

(77:32) It throws sparks as huge as logs.

(77:33) As if they were yellow camels.

(77:34) Woe on that Day to the disbelievers!

(77:35) This is a Day when they shall not speak.

(77:36) Nor will it be permitted for them so they can make excuses.

(77:37) Woe on that Day to the disbelievers!

(77:38) This is the Day of Separation where We have gathered you with
the ancient people.

(77:39) So if you have a plan, then make use of it.

(77:40) Woe on that Day to the disbelievers!

(77:41) The righteous are among shades and springs.

(77:42) And fruit from what they desire.

(77:43) "Eat and drink comfortably for what you used to do."

(77:44) It is such that We reward the good doers.

(77:45) Woe on that Day to the disbelievers!

(77:46) "Eat and enjoy for a little while, for you are criminals."

(77:47) Woe on that Day to the disbelievers!

(77:48) And when they are told to kneel, they do not kneel.

(77:49) Woe on that Day to the disbelievers!

(77:50) So in what narrative, after it, will they believe?
