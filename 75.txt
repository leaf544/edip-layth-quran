(75:1) I do swear by the Day of Resurrection.

(75:2) And I do swear by the soul which is self blaming.

(75:3) Does man think that We will not gather his bones?

(75:4) Indeed, We were able to make his fingertips.

(75:5) No, man desires that he continues committing sins.

(75:6) He asks: "When is the Day of Resurrection?"

(75:7) So, when the sight is dazzled.

(75:8) And the moon is eclipsed.

(75:9) And the sun and the moon are joined together.

(75:10) Man will say on that Day: "Where can I escape!"

(75:11) No. There is no refuge.

(75:12) To your Lord on that Day is the abode.

(75:13) Man will be told on that Day what he has put forward, and what
he has done.

(75:14) Indeed, man will testify against himself.

(75:15) Even though he puts forth his excuses.

(75:16) Do not move your tongue with it to make haste.

(75:17) It is for Us to gather and relate it.

(75:18) So when We relate it, you shall follow its revelation.

(75:19) Then it is for Us to explain it.

(75:20) Alas, you all like this world.

(75:21) And neglect the Hereafter.

(75:22) Faces on that Day will be shining.

(75:23) Looking at their Lord.

(75:24) And faces on that Day will be gloomy.

(75:25) Thinking that a punishment is coming to them.

(75:26) Alas, when it reaches the throat.

(75:27) And it will be said: "Who can save him?"

(75:28) And he assumes it is the time of passing.

(75:29) And the leg is buckled around the other leg.

(75:30) To your Lord on that Day he will be driven.

(75:31) For he did not believe nor make the contact.

(75:32) But he denied and turned away.

(75:33) Then he went to his family admiring himself.

(75:34) Woe to you and woe to you.

(75:35) Then woe to you and woe to you.

(75:36) Did man think that he will be left neglected?

(75:37) Was he not a seed from sperm put forth?

(75:38) Then he was an embryo, so he was created and developed.

(75:39) Then He made from it the pair, the male and the female.

(75:40) Is One as such then not able to resurrect the dead?
