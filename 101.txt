(101:2) What is the Shocker?

(101:3) And how would you know what the Shocker is?

(101:4) The Day when people come out like swarms of butterflies.

(101:5) And the mountains will be like fluffed up wool.

(101:6) As for him whose weights are heavy.

(101:7) He will be in a happy life.

(101:8) As for him whose weights are light.

(101:9) His destiny is the lowest.

(101:10) And how would you know what it is?

(101:11) A blazing Fire.
