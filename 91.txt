(91:1) By the Sun and its brightness.

(91:2) And the Moon that comes after it.

(91:3) And the day when it reveals.

(91:4) And the night when it covers.

(91:5) And the heaven and what He built.

(91:6) And the earth and what He sustains.

(91:7) And a soul and what He made.

(91:8) So He gave it its evil and good.

(91:9) Successful is the one who betters it.

(91:10) And failing is the one who hides it.

(91:11) Thamud denied their transgression.

(91:12) They followed the worst among them.

(91:13) So the messenger of God said to them: "This is the camel of
God and her place of drinking."

(91:14) But they disbelieved him, and they killed her. So their Lord
repaid them for their sin and leveled it.

(91:15) Yet, those who came after remain heedless.
