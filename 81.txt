(81:1) When the sun extends.

(81:2) And when the stars cannot be seen.

(81:3) And when the mountains are made to move.

(81:4) And when the reproduction is ended.

(81:5) And when the beasts are herded.

(81:6) And when the seas are made to boil.

(81:7) And when the souls are paired.

(81:8) And when the girl killed in infancy is asked,

(81:9) "For what crime was she killed?"

(81:10) And when the scripts are displayed.

(81:11) And when the sky is removed.

(81:12) And when Hell is ignited.

(81:13) And when the Paradise is made near.

(81:14) Every soul will know what it had done!

(81:15) So I do swear by the planets that move away.

(81:16) Running in their orbits.

(81:17) And the night when it passes.

(81:18) And the morning when it breathes.

(81:19) It is the saying of an honorable messenger.

(81:20) With power and influence from the One upon the Throne.

(81:21) Obeyed, and trustworthy.

(81:22) And your friend is not crazy.

(81:23) And he saw him by the clear horizon.

(81:24) And he has no knowledge of the future.

(81:25) And it is not the saying of an outcast devil.

(81:26) So where will you go?

(81:27) It is but a reminder for the worlds.

(81:28) For whoever of you wishes to be straight.

(81:29) And you cannot will anything except if it is also willed by
God, Lord of the worlds.
