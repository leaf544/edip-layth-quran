(78:1) What are they inquiring about?

(78:2) About the significant news.

(78:3) The one which they are in disagreement about.

(78:4) No, they will come to know.

(78:5) No, then again, they will come to know.

(78:6) Did We not make the earth a resting ground?

(78:7) And the mountains as pegs?

(78:8) And We created you in pairs?

(78:9) And We made your sleep for resting?

(78:10) And We made the night as a covering?

(78:11) And We made the day to work in?

(78:12) And We constructed above you seven mighty ones?

(78:13) And We made a blazing lamp?

(78:14) And We sent down from the clouds abundant water,

(78:15) To bring out with it seeds and plants,

(78:16) And gardens of thick growth?

(78:17) The Day of Separation is an appointed time.

(78:18) The Day when the horn is blown and you come in crowds.

(78:19) And the heaven is opened, so it becomes gates.

(78:20) And the mountains will be moved as if they were a mirage.

(78:21) For Hell is in wait.

(78:22) For the transgressors it is a dwelling.

(78:23) They will be in it for eons.

(78:24) They will not taste any coolness in it nor drink.

(78:25) Except that which is boiling and dark.

(78:26) An exact recompense.

(78:27) They did not expect the reckoning.

(78:28) And they denied Our revelations greatly.

(78:29) And everything We have counted in a record.

(78:30) So taste it, for no increase will come to you from Us except
in retribution.

(78:31) As for the righteous, they will have triumph.

(78:32) Gardens and vineyards.

(78:33) And bunches that are ripe.

(78:34) And a cup that is full.

(78:35) They do not hear in it any vain talk or lies.

(78:36) A reward from your Lord, in recognition for what is done.

(78:37) The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between
them, the Almighty. They do not possess any authority besides Him.

(78:38) The Day when the Spirit and the angels stand in line, none
will speak unless the Almighty permits him and he speaks what is true.

(78:39) That is the Day of truth, so let whoever wills seek refuge to
his Lord.

(78:40) I have warned you of a retribution which is close, the Day
when man will look at what he has brought forth and the rejecter will
say: "I wish I were dust!"
