(89:1) By the dawn.

(89:2) And ten nights.

(89:3) And the even and the odd.

(89:4) And the night when it passes.

(89:5) Is there in that an oath for he who is confined?

(89:6) Did you not see what your Lord did to 'Aad?

(89:7) Irum, with the great columns?

(89:8) The one which was like no other in the land?

(89:9) And Thamud who carved the rocks in the valley?

(89:10) And Pharaoh with the planks?

(89:11) They all transgressed in the land.

(89:12) And made much corruption therein.

(89:13) So your Lord poured upon them a measure of retribution.

(89:14) Your Lord is ever watchful.

(89:15) As for man, if his Lord tests him and grants him much, then he
says: "My Lord has blessed me!"

(89:16) And if his Lord tests him and gives him little wealth, then he
says: "My Lord has humiliated me!"

(89:17) No, you are not generous to the orphan.

(89:18) And you do not look to feeding the poor.

(89:19) And you consume others inheritance, all with greed.

(89:20) And you love money, a love that is excessive.

(89:21) Alas, when the earth is pounded into rubble.

(89:22) And your Lord comes with the angels row after row.

(89:23) And Hell on that Day is brought. On that Day man will
remember, but how will the remembrance now help him?

(89:24) He says: "I wish I had worked towards my life!"

(89:25) On that Day, no other will bear his punishment.

(89:26) And none can bind as He will bind.

(89:27) "O you soul which is peaceful."

(89:28) "Return to your Lord happy and content."

(89:29) "And enter in among My servants."

(89:30) "And enter My Paradise."
